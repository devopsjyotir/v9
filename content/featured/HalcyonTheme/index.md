A user-friendly app that helps me find the perfect place to live based on my interests.
The app features a RESTful API built with Express, MongoDB, and Node.js, with full CRUD functionality and tested backend routes.
The frontend utilizes ES6 template literals and Styled-Components to deliver a sleek, modern design using CSS3 and flexbox layout.
